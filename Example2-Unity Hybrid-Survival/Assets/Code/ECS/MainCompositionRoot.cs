//Note on this example:
//When developing with svelto the user would need to plan a bit what entities need to be used and
//what behaviours these entities will have. Engines can be added over the time, so the key is to have
//a good idea of the entities to work on. All the reasoning should always start from the EntityDescriptors
//Entity Components can be added over the time of course, but it's important to establish what entities
//will come into play.
//The key entities (and relative entity descriptors) for this demo are:
//Player
//PlayerGun
//Enemy
//Camera
//HUD
//Once the first entity descriptors are designed, it becomes simpler to start build these entities and
//write the engines for their behaviours.

//Main is the Application Composition Root. A Composition Root is the where all the dependencies are 
//created and injected (I talk a lot about this in my articles) A composition root belongs to the Context, but
//a context can have more than a composition root. For example a factory is a composition root.
//Furthermore an application can have more than a context/composition root but this is more advanced and not part of this demo

        ///     - IEntityComponent:
        ///     It's an Entity Component which can be used with Pure ECS
        ///     - IEntityViewComponent:
        ///     components implementing this are used to wrap Objects that come from OOP libraries. You will never use it unless
        ///     you are forced to mix your ECS code with OOP code because of external libraries or platforms. These special
        ///     "Hybrid" component can hold only interfaces

        ///     The EntityComponent exposed interfaces must be implemented by Implementors that are actually the
        ///     Objects you need to wrap.
        ///     - EntityDescriptors:
